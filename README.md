There were a lot of changes to what we made once I talked with David. I pushed all of them at once. Going forward from, 7/7 2:18pm, we should do specific commits.

7/7 9:45pm - added code for AuthenticationController, User.java, and started a UserService. In the Authentication controller, I named the login page "login" and the signup page "signup". These can be changed to whatever you call the html's you are working on. There is also an error in the AuthenicationCOntroller because I am referencing get methods that havent been created yet in the UserService.
